# Social Network API

## Description

As a future code developer it is important to know how the social media platforms develop their APIs. For this reason I have created my own basic Social Network API. The task is to create database that does not use sequal but instead uses mongoDB. Future development includes deploying it to a site like heroku and allowing others to access it and create a user account, add other users as friends, share thoughts (unique to their account), and post comments on other User's thoughts.

## Installation

For now, in order to use this API you must pull the repository and install the required dependancies. 
To make the calls either download Insomnia and make them there 
    or Install the REST client extension in VS Code and use the insomnia.http routes set up in the repo

## Usage

Running nmp start in the terminal will start a local server and then use insomnia to make the api calls to create create, update and delete Users, Thoughts, and Comments.

- For this DEMO i used REST client vscode extension (works like insomnia but in vscode)
