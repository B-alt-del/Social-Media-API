# Social Network API

## Description

As a future code developer it is important to know how the social media platforms develop their APIs. For this reason I have created my own basic Social Network API. The task is to create database that does not use sequal but instead uses mongoDB. Future development includes deploying it to a site like heroku and allowing others to access it and create a user account, add other users as friends, share thoughts (unique to their account), and post comments on other User's thoughts.

## Installation

For now, in order to use this API you must pull the repository and install the required dependancies. Download and install Insomnia to easily make API calls.

## Usage

Walkthrough Video: (inssert walkthrough video here)

Running nmp start in the terminal will start a local server and then use insomnia to make the api calls to create create, update and delete Users, Thoughts, and Comments.
